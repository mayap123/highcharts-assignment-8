  <p> European students may participate in study abroad programs in other European countries, or they may travel to other continents. They can take university courses in their new host country. Students usually live with a host family. Studying abroad often goes hand in hand with learning a foreign language. Time abroad can not only help students practice another language, but also immerse themselves in another culture. </p>

  <p> It can be easier to navigate studying abroad if one speaks the language of their host country. With so many neighboring countries that speak different languages, Europeans are in a good position to learn more languages. Most European countries have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/13/learning-a-foreign-language-a-must-in-europe-not-so-in-america/">national-level mandates</a> for formally studying languages in school. You can read <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/06/most-european-students-are-learning-a-foreign-language-in-school-while-americans-lag/">here</a> about how more European students learn languages in school compared to American students (Pew Research).  </p>
